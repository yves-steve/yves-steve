# 👋 Hi, I'm Yves Laingui (@kudu-star)

## 🚀 About Me
- 🥩 Kudu is my favourite form of solid state meat aka biltong (this might give you a clue as to where I originate from)
- 💼 I'm a recovering Exchange Engineer, thanks Microsoft 😅 (They said "the cloud is the future" and here I am!)
- 👀 I'm interested in learning anything tech-related (if it has buttons, I'll click them)
- 🧠 I bought my gaming PC - and it rocks! (Intel who? 😏)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python scripting, Cloud Infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP) and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- 💼 Working with multi-cloud deployments and security best practices
- ☕ Powered by coffee and occasional Stack Overflow and Github panic searches
- 🐛 I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production (just kidding... mostly)

## 🔭 Current Projects

### [🐙 fictional-octo-system](https://github.com/yves-steve/fictional-octo-system)
A work-in-progress multi-cloud Infrastructure as Code repository featuring:
- 🌩️ Multi-cloud infrastructure automation (Azure, AWS, GCP) with Terraform
- 🔒 Security compliance and policy management across clouds
- 💰 Cost optimization and FinOps practices
- 🔐 GitHub OIDC authentication for secure CI/CD pipelines
- 📊 Automated security scanning with tfsec

*Teaching computers to follow rules so humans don't have to (and explaining cloud bills to management)*

## 💡 Fun Facts
- My code is like my sense of humour: occasionally works, often needs debugging
- I speak three languages: English, PowerShell, and Profanity (mostly when Terraform applies fail)
- My tech relationship status: It's complicated just like Kubernetes.
