# 👋 Hi, I'm Yves Laingui

## 🚀 About Me
- ☎️ My GitHub username "Yves-Steve" is a play on words that originates from people mishearing my name on the phone, so I usually play along
- 🥩 Kudu is my favourite form of solid-state meat aka biltong (this might give you a clue as to where I originate from)
- 💼 I'm a recovering Exchange Engineer, thanks to Microsoft 😅 (They said "the cloud is the future" and here I am!)
- 👀 I'm interested in learning anything tech-related (if it has buttons, I'll click them)
- 🧠 I bought my gaming PC - and it rocks! (Intel who? 😏)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python scripting, Cloud Infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP) and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- 💼 Working with multi-cloud deployments and security best practices
- ☕ Powered by coffee and occasional Stack Overflow and GitHub panic searches
- 🐛 I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production (just kidding... mostly)
